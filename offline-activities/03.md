## Answers

### By reading and watching about the discoveries that led to Semaglutide and SARS-Cov-2 mRNA vaccines, what commonalities did you perceive?

They both faced initial challenges that the original product would not  survive long enough in human body, making it difficult for therapeutic usage, and the problem was solved by making modifications to the original molecules (attaching fatty acid for GLP1 and modifying nucleotide (pseudouridine) for mRNA)

### What differences striked you most?

The most striking difference is of course their therapeutic mechanism but I guess it's the nature of vaccine vs medicine? mRNA vaccine basically leverages the body's own protein-making mechinery to produce antigens, which then prompt the immune system to recognize and fight pathogens. Semaglutide works by mimicking nature hormone to ease the effect of type 2 diabetes. (If Semaglutide stimulates the cells to produce more GLP1, it will be another story)

Also, for Semaglutide the development was a longer, gradual process over decades, involving many incremental innovations and clinical trials. While for mRNA vaccine, although the foundational research spanned years, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the timeline, with mRNA vaccines being developed, tested, and approved within a year.
