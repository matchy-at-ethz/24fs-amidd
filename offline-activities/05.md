# Lecture 5: Protein-ligand interaction

- Choose **one** task below to perform. In each case, consider using the [Feynman technique](https://law-hawaii.libguides.com/notetaking/feynman).
  - If you have a strong background in mathematics/statistics and particularly in machine learning, please review the material shared in the slides about proteins so that you gain more knowledge about drug targets.
  - If you have a strong background in biology but yet to develop more skills in machine learning, please read [An Introduction to Machine Learning](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.1796), and try to understand the concepts.
  - If you have strong background in both fields, please read [Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w), by Abramson _et al_.
- Confirm that you have performed one of the tasks above by [filling out this Google Form](https://forms.gle/PooBkFR3rwd7cssy9). Deadline: Friday of lecture 6.

### I finished the following task

- [ ] Reading about proteins
- [ ] Reading about machine learning
- [x] Reading about machine learing applied to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction

### If you are asked to explain the essentials of what you learned to a high-school student, how would you do it?

Imagine you're building with LEGO blocks. Initially, you might create simple structures by following basic instructions. This is similar to how scientists used to predict protein structuresâ€”they could only make rough estimates based on limited information. 3 years ago, Deepmind announces AlphaFold2, which is a game changer. It was like receiving an advanced guidebook that helps you assemble complex LEGO models just by examining the pieces. It predicts the 3D structure of a protein using only its amino acid sequence. Alphafold3 builds upon AlphaFold2, much like having an even smarter friend who helps you construct not just individual LEGO models but entire cities where models interact and move. It can do the following things that Alphafold2 previously cannot do:
Here's what makes AlphaFold3 special compared to AlphaFold2:

Understanding Interactions: AlphaFold3 doesn't just look at one protein at a time. It can predict how multiple proteins interact with each other. This is important because proteins often work together in our bodies.

Predicting Movements: Proteins aren't static; they move and change shapes. AlphaFold3 can predict these movements, helping scientists understand how proteins work over time.

Handling Complex Proteins: Some proteins are like complicated LEGO sets with thousands of pieces. AlphaFold3 can tackle these complex proteins better than AlphaFold2 could.

### If you have any questions and/or comments, please share them here.

Nope.
